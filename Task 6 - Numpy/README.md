**Fun Facts**

- Numpy was one of the technologies that were used to take the first image of a blackhole by Event Horizon Telescope.
- It was also used to detect gravitational waves by LIGO.
- Many libraries depends on Numpy such as [Dask](https://dask.org/) ans [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/) to help in GPU accelerated and distributed computing.
