# Task 7 - Probability

Statistics and probability are different but strongly related fields in mathematics.

| Probability                                                                                      | Statistics                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In probability we make predictions about future events based on models or causes that we assume. | Where as in statistics we analyze the data from past events to infer what that models and causes could be. |
| In one you are predicting data and                                                               | In the other you are using data to predict.                                                                |

- There is also almost and opposite relation in these two.

## Properties

- $P(A) = 1 - P(\neg A)$
  - Opposite events
- $P(A, B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$
  - Composite events
